BestNest is a tool to help renters in Chattanooga learn more about the properties they are interested in using open data.

This project is for the front end client of BestNest. If you are interested in the API, please visit the [bestnest-api repo](https://github.com/codeforamerica/bestnest-api).

This software is currently being developed by the Code for America Chattanooga team.

### this is young software

BestNest is undergoing frequent development and iteration at this stage. That shouldn't stop you from poking around though :)

It is currently being developed at [dev.bestnestapp.com]()


## Install and deploy

BestNest is broken out into a client and an [API](https://github.com/codeforamerica/bestnest-api). To get this client installed locally follow these simple steps:

1. `$ git clone git@github.com:codeforamerica/bestnest-app.git && cd bestnest-app`
2. `$ npm install`
3. `$ npm start`

That's it! A web browser should open with the local instance of BestNest.

Since the data is all being served from the [development API](http://dev.api.bestnestapp.com/), you don't need a database set up on your local machine.
