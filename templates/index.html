      <h1>Welcome to BestNest!</h1>
      <p>The goal is to help renters in town learn more about the homes they want to rent.</p>
      <p>We do that by showing things you'd like to know such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>who owns the home</li>
        <li>any code violations on the home</li>
        <li>public transit options from that home</li>
        <li>& more coming soon!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Try it out!</h2>
      <p>Go ahead and search for an address in Chattanooga. When you're done we'd love to hear what you think.<p>
